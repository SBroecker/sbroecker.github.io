I taught [ECS 122B: Algorithm Design & Analysis](https://cs.ucdavis.edu/schedules-classes/ecs-122b-algorithm-design-analysis) in the Winter Quarter of 2023.

I hope to teach again soon!

Previous to that, I TA'd [ECS 188: Ethics in an Age of Technology](https://cs.ucdavis.edu/schedules-classes/ecs-188-ethics-age-technology), [ECS 172: Recommender Systems](https://cs.ucdavis.edu/schedules-classes/ecs-172-recommender-systems), and [ECS 122B: Algorithm Design & Analysis](https://cs.ucdavis.edu/schedules-classes/ecs-122b-algorithm-design-analysis).
