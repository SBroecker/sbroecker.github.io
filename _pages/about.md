Hi, I'm Stefan Broecker! I'm currently a PhD Candidate in the Department of Computer Science at UC Davis working under [Dr. Thomas Strohmer](https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~strohmer/) in the Department of Mathematics. My PhD work sits at the intersection of multimodal machine learning, synthetic data generation, and privacy. Which is a fancy way of saying that I'm developing models that can create convincing fake data, particularly in the medical field, while ensuring that the fake data doesn't compromise the privacy of real individuals.

My path to get here meandered, but roughly:

- I'm currently deep into my PhD research, exploring synthetic data generation and multimodal deep learning.
- Most recently, I spent a summer at [Okareo](https://okareo.com/), where I focused on synthetic data generation and model evaluation for Large Language Models (LLMs).
- My initial dive into privacy and synthetic data was with the US Census Bureau, where I built differential privacy tools for healthcare data. You can see some of that [here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SBroecker/cif/main/Privacy%20Models%20for%20EHealth%20-%20Intro%20and%20Scope.html).
- Before grad school I worked in Data Science with a particular emphasis on civic tech â€” an interest that continues to drive my work today.
- And prior to all of that I worked on science and technology policy as part of the University of Virginia's [Policy Internship Program](https://engineering.virginia.edu/offices-programs/policy-internship-program).

If any or all of that sounds interesting to you, reach out! I'm always eager to collaborate on a project or talk about what's going on in AI, privacy, or tech.
